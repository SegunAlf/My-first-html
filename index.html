    <p id="reason"> 
        I would like to outline a few reasons why I consider web developemt as a career path;
        To start with, <b><i> Degree:</i></b> the need for degree or prior educational background is not required to become a web developer. Studies shows the huge growth of home trained web developers around the world with no prior or basic programming skills, thanks to platforms that offers these training  on a free or low fee rates.
        <b><i>Creativity:</i></b> I find web develpment to be a very creative space, where developer can be creative with how solutions are proffered to real world problems
       <b><i>Fun:</i> </b> I find web development to be fun because of the constant growth in web development and ability to use different approaches when coding. Although this does not mean it is without difficulties which makes it fun and interesting 
        <b><i>Work flexibility:</i></b> I believe one benefit of being a web developer is the advantage of been able to work from anywhere around the world, most especially remotely 
       <b><i> Earning:</i></b> Earning potnetial is huge in the tech space and having the requisite skill can improve my rate earning."According to Glassdoor, the average London-based web developer can earn up to Â£50,000 a year. And the career path doesn't stop there, you can expand into other areas where the money is higher. 
        As with many jobs in IT, 'web developer' encompasses a lot of things and you'll have the ability to specialise in different areas. The good thing about specialising is that it normally means more money and more demand" 
        <b><i>Job Availablity:</i></b> The reason Web developer earns high is due to the huge demand by many organizations and it happens to be an appealing skill for me to hone.
